# Lab #9: ENV instruction
https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/beginners/dockerfile/Lab_%239_ENV_instruction.html

The `ENV` instruction in Dockerfile sets the environment variable for your container when you start. The default value can be overridden by passing `--env <key>=<value>` when you start the container.

## Assignment
- Writing a Dockerfile with `ENV` instruction
- Building Docker Image
- Running container `env:v1`
- Override existing `env` while running container

## Command Line Tools
There are two prime commands for managing (starting and stopping) the provided service.

### Start the service
The following command runs the full command sequence:
```sh
$ ./start
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh start
```

### Stop the service
The following command clears all of the output (removing all possible side-effects) generated by running the *start* command:
```sh
$ ./clear
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh clear
```

### Underlying commands
There are multiple underlying scripts used for building the service functions. The sections below describe the commands used for managing the provided service and building the necessary resources.

#### Pre-requisite
There should be the following files (committed) in your working directory:
- *Dockerfile*

In case any of them missing, run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.

#### Writing a Dockerfile with ENV instruction

*Dockerfile*
```docker
FROM alpine:3.9.3
LABEL maintainer="Collabnix"

ENV WELCOME_MESSAGE="Welcome to Docker World"

CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo $WELCOME_MESSAGE"]
```

Placed into *[create.sh](./create.sh)*.

#### Building Docker Image

```sh
$ docker image build -t arg:v1 .
```

Placed into *[build.sh](./build.sh)*.

#### Running container `env:v1`

```sh
$ docker container run env:v1
Welcome to Docker World
```

Placed into *[run.sh](./run.sh)*.

#### Override existing env while running container
```sh
$ docker image build -t arg:v2 --build-arg WELCOME_USER=Savio .
```

## Utils / Trivia

### Images

#### Build image
```sh
$ docker image build -t <tag> .
$ docker build -t <tag> . -f <dockerfile-name>
```

#### Browse image history
```sh
$ docker image history <image>

#### List images
```sh
# Lists all images
$ docker images
$ docker image ls

# List a specific image
$ docker images <image>
$ docker image ls <image>
$ docker images | grep "keyword(s)"
```

#### Remove images
Below are the three command aliases:
```sh
$ docker image remove <image>
$ docker image rm <image>
$ docker rmi <image>
```

### Containers

#### Create (run) a container
```sh
$ docker container run <container>
$ docker run <container>
```

#### List containers
```sh
# List running containers
$ docker ps
# Lists all (running and stopped) containers
$ docker ps -a
```

#### Exit the container shell
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to exit the container shell. This stops the running container.

If you want to detach from a container without stopping it, type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>. It will help you to turn interactive mode to daemon mode.

#### Remove containers
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/rm/

#### Remove a container
This removes the container referenced under the link `/redis`.
```sh
$ docker rm /redis

/redis
```

#### Force-remove a running container (`--force`)
This command force-removes a running container.
```sh
$ docker rm --force redis

redis
```

The main process inside the container referenced under the link `redis` will receive `SIGKILL`, then the container will be removed.

#### Remove all stopped containers
Use the [`docker container prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/prune/) command to remove all stopped containers, or refer to the [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/prune/) command to remove unused containers in addition to other Docker resources, such as (unused) images and networks.

Alternatively, you can use the `docker ps` with the `-q` / `--quiet` option to generate a list of container IDs to remove, and use that list as argument for the `docker rm` command.

Combining commands can be more flexible, but is less portable as it depends on features provided by the shell, and the exact syntax may differ depending on what shell is used. To use this approach on Windows, consider using PowerShell or Bash.

The example below uses `docker ps -q` to print the IDs of all containers that have exited (`--filter status=exited`), and removes those containers with the `docker rm` command:
```sh
$ docker rm $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q)
```

Or, using the `xargs` Linux utility:
```sh
$ docker ps --filter status=exited -q | xargs docker rm
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fix `permission denied` error
If you get the *permission denied* error while building the service scripts, make the script file executable:
```sh
$ chmod +x start
```

or:
```
$ chmod u+x clear
```

### Fix `failed to read dockerfile` error
If you get the *ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile* error while running the service, probably you have your *Dockerfile* or other crucial static files missing. Run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.
