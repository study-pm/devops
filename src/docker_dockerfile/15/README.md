## Overview
Shell instruction syntax
```docker
SHELL ["executable", "parameters"]
```

- The `SHELL` instruction allows the default shell used for the shell form of commands to be overridden. The default shell on Linux is `["/bin/sh", "-c"]`, and on Windows is `["cmd", "/S", "/C"]`. The `SHELL` instruction must be written in JSON form in a Dockerfile.

- The `SHELL` instruction is particularly useful on Windows where there are two commonly used and quite different native shells: cmd and powershell, as well as alternate shells available including sh.

- The `SHELL` instruction can appear multiple times. Each `SHELL` instruction overrides all previous `SHELL` instructions, and affects all subsequent instructions.

## Assignment
- Create a *Dockerfile* with `SHELL` instruction
- Build a Docker Image
- Check that the nginx config file exists
- Check if nginx is healthy
- Make Docker container Unhealthy and check
- Create the *nginx.conf* file and Making the container go healthy

## Command Line Tools
There are two prime commands for managing (starting and stopping) the provided service.

### Start the service
The following command runs the full command sequence:
```sh
$ ./start
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh start
```

### Stop the service
The following command clears all of the output (removing all possible side-effects) generated by running the *start* command:
```sh
$ ./clear
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh clear
```

### Underlying commands
There are multiple underlying scripts used for building the service functions. The sections below describe the commands used for managing the provided service and building the necessary resources.

#### Pre-requisite
> ❗ To build and run Windows containers, a Windows system with container support ([Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)) is required.

There should be the following files in your working directory:
- *Dockerfile* (committed)

In case any of them missing, run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.

All temporary files are removed on running the *[clear.sh](./clear.sh)* script.

#### Writing a *Dockerfile* with `SHELL` instruction
The following instructions can be affected by the `SHELL` instruction when the shell form of them is used in a Dockerfile: `RUN`, `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.

##### Create Dockerfile

*Dockerfile*
```docker
FROM windowsservercore

# Executed as cmd /S /C echo default
RUN echo default

# Executed as cmd /S /C powershell -command Write-Host default
RUN powershell -command Write-Host default

# Executed as powershell -command Write-Host hello
SHELL ["powershell", "-command"]
RUN Write-Host hello

# Executed as cmd /S /C echo hello
SHELL ["cmd", "/S"", "/C"]
RUN echo hello
```

Placed into *[create.sh](./create.sh)*.

The following example is a common pattern found on Windows which can be streamlined by using the `SHELL` instruction:

```docker
RUN powershell -command Execute-MyCmdlet -param1 "c:\foo.txt"
```

The command invoked by docker will be:
```ps
cmd /S /C powershell -command Execute-MyCmdlet -param1 "c:\foo.txt"
```

- This is inefficient for two reasons. First, there is an un-necessary *cmd.exe* command processor (aka shell) being invoked. Second, each `RUN` instruction in the shell form requires an extra powershell `-command` prefixing the command.

- To make this more efficient, one of two mechanisms can be employed. One is to use the JSON form of the RUN command such as:

```docker
RUN ["powershell", "-command", "Execute-MyCmdlet", "-param1 \"c:\\foo.txt\""]
```

While the JSON form is unambiguous and does not use the un-necessary *cmd.exe*, it does require more verbosity through double-quoting and escaping. The alternate mechanism is to use the `SHELL` instruction and the shell form, making a more natural syntax for Windows users, especially when combined with the escape parser directive:
```ps
# escape=`

FROM windowsservercore
SHELL ["powershell","-command"]
RUN New-Item -ItemType Directory C:\Example
ADD Execute-MyCmdlet.ps1 c:\example\
RUN c:\example\Execute-MyCmdlet -sample 'hello world'
```

##### Building Docker Image

```sh
PS E:\docker\build\shell> docker build -t shell .
```

Placed into *[build.sh](./build.sh)*.

</details>

- The `SHELL` instruction could also be used to modify the way in which a shell operates. For example, using SHELL cmd /S /C /V:ON|OFF on Windows, delayed environment variable expansion semantics could be modified.
The SHELL instruction can also be used on Linux should an alternate shell be required such zsh, csh, tcsh and others.
The SHELL feature was added in Docker 1.12.

## Utils / Trivia

### Images

#### Build image
```sh
$ docker image build -t <tag> .
$ docker build -t <tag> . -f <dockerfile-name>
```

#### Browse image history
```sh
$ docker image history <image>

#### List images
```sh
# Lists all images
$ docker images
$ docker image ls

# List a specific image
$ docker images <image>
$ docker image ls <image>
$ docker images | grep "keyword(s)"
```

#### Remove images
Below are the three command aliases:
```sh
$ docker image remove <image>
$ docker image rm <image>
$ docker rmi <image>
```

### Containers

#### Create (run) a container
```sh
$ docker container run <image>
$ docker run <image>
```

#### List containers
```sh
# List running containers
$ docker ps
$ docker container ls

# Lists all (running and stopped) containers
$ docker ps -a
```

#### Exit the container shell
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to exit the container shell. This stops the running container.

If you want to detach from a container without stopping it, type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>. It will help you to turn interactive mode to daemon mode.

#### Remove containers
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/rm/

#### Remove a container
This removes the container referenced under the link `/redis`.
```sh
$ docker rm /redis

/redis
```

#### Force-remove a running container (`--force`)
This command force-removes a running container.
```sh
$ docker rm --force redis

redis
```

The main process inside the container referenced under the link `redis` will receive `SIGKILL`, then the container will be removed.

#### Remove all stopped containers
Use the [`docker container prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/prune/) command to remove all stopped containers, or refer to the [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/prune/) command to remove unused containers in addition to other Docker resources, such as (unused) images and networks.

Alternatively, you can use the `docker ps` with the `-q` / `--quiet` option to generate a list of container IDs to remove, and use that list as argument for the `docker rm` command.

Combining commands can be more flexible, but is less portable as it depends on features provided by the shell, and the exact syntax may differ depending on what shell is used. To use this approach on Windows, consider using PowerShell or Bash.

The example below uses `docker ps -q` to print the IDs of all containers that have exited (`--filter status=exited`), and removes those containers with the `docker rm` command:
```sh
$ docker rm $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q)
```

Or, using the `xargs` Linux utility:
```sh
$ docker ps --filter status=exited -q | xargs docker rm
```

### Volumes
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/volume/

Manage volumes. Usage: `docker volume COMMAND`

#### Create a volume
```sh
$ docker volume create
```

#### List volumes

```sh
$ docker volume ls
```

Show names and mount point destinations of volumes used by a container:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30133664/how-do-you-list-volumes-in-docker-containers

```sh
$ docker container inspect \
 -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ .Name }}:{{ .Destination }} {{ end }}' \
 <CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME>
```

#### Inspect volume

```sh
$ docker volume inspect
```

#### Remove volumes
Remove unused local volumes:
```sh
# With confirmation dialogue
$ docker volume prune

# Without confirmation
$ docker volume prune -f
```

Remove one or more volumes:
```sh
$ docker volume rm <volumes>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fix `permission denied` error
If you get the *permission denied* error while building the service scripts, make the script file executable:
```sh
$ chmod +x start
```

or:
```
$ chmod u+x clear
```

### Fix `failed to read dockerfile` error
If you get the *ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile* error while running the service, probably you have your *Dockerfile* or other crucial static files missing. Run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.
