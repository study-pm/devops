## Overview
You can add labels to your image to help organize images by project, record licensing information, to aid in automation, or for other reasons. For each label, add a line beginning with `LABEL` and with one or more key-value pairs. The following examples show the different acceptable formats.

Docker offers support to add labels into images as a way to add custom metadata on them.

The label syntax on your Dockerfile is as follows:
```docker
LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...
```

The `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a key-value pair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and backslashes as you would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:
```docker
LABEL "com.example.vendor"="ACME Incorporated"
LABEL com.example.label-with-value="foo"
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="This text illustrates \
that label-values can span multiple lines."
```

An image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a single line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image, but this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple labels in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:
```docker
LABEL multi.label1="value1" multi.label2="value2" other="value3"
```
```docker
LABEL multi.label1="value1" \
      multi.label2="value2" \
      other="value3"
```

Labels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are inherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value, the most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.

To view an imageâ€™s labels, use the `docker inspect` command.
```json
"Labels": {
    "com.example.vendor": "ACME Incorporated"
    "com.example.label-with-value": "foo",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "This text illustrates that label-values can span multiple lines.",
    "multi.label1": "value1",
    "multi.label2": "value2",
    "other": "value3"
},
```

## Assignment
- Create an image with `LABEL` instruction
- View the image labesl

## Command Line Tools
There are two prime commands for managing (starting and stopping) the provided service.

### Start the service
The following command runs the full command sequence:
```sh
$ ./start
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh start
```

### Stop the service
The following command clears all of the output (removing all possible side-effects) generated by running the *start* command:
```sh
$ ./clear
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh clear
```

### Underlying commands
There are multiple underlying scripts used for building the service functions. The sections below describe the commands used for managing the provided service and building the necessary resources.

#### Pre-requisite
There should be the following files in your working directory:
- *Dockerfile* (committed)

In case any of them missing, run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.

All temporary files are removed on running the *[clear.sh](./clear.sh)* script

#### Create an image with `LABEL` instruction

##### Create Dockerfile

*Dockerfile*
```docker
FROM alpine:3.5
RUN echo "Hello Docker"
LABEL name="learning-docker"
LABEL email="[email protected]"
```

Placed into *[create.sh](./create.sh)*.

##### Building Docker Image

```sh
$ docker build -t label:v1 .
```

Placed into *[build.sh](./build.sh)*.

##### Checking the label information
```sh
$  docker image inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}' <image>
```

## Utils / Trivia

### Images

#### Build image
```sh
$ docker image build -t <tag> .
$ docker build -t <tag> . -f <dockerfile-name>
```

#### Browse image history
```sh
$ docker image history <image>

#### List images
```sh
# Lists all images
$ docker images
$ docker image ls

# List a specific image
$ docker images <image>
$ docker image ls <image>
$ docker images | grep "keyword(s)"
```

#### Remove images
Below are the three command aliases:
```sh
$ docker image remove <image>
$ docker image rm <image>
$ docker rmi <image>
```

### Containers

#### Create (run) a container
```sh
$ docker container run <image>
$ docker run <image>
```

#### List containers
```sh
# List running containers
$ docker ps
$ docker container ls

# Lists all (running and stopped) containers
$ docker ps -a
```

#### Exit the container shell
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to exit the container shell. This stops the running container.

If you want to detach from a container without stopping it, type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>. It will help you to turn interactive mode to daemon mode.

#### Remove containers
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/rm/

#### Remove a container
This removes the container referenced under the link `/redis`.
```sh
$ docker rm /redis

/redis
```

#### Force-remove a running container (`--force`)
This command force-removes a running container.
```sh
$ docker rm --force redis

redis
```

The main process inside the container referenced under the link `redis` will receive `SIGKILL`, then the container will be removed.

#### Remove all stopped containers
Use the [`docker container prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/prune/) command to remove all stopped containers, or refer to the [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/prune/) command to remove unused containers in addition to other Docker resources, such as (unused) images and networks.

Alternatively, you can use the `docker ps` with the `-q` / `--quiet` option to generate a list of container IDs to remove, and use that list as argument for the `docker rm` command.

Combining commands can be more flexible, but is less portable as it depends on features provided by the shell, and the exact syntax may differ depending on what shell is used. To use this approach on Windows, consider using PowerShell or Bash.

The example below uses `docker ps -q` to print the IDs of all containers that have exited (`--filter status=exited`), and removes those containers with the `docker rm` command:
```sh
$ docker rm $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q)
```

Or, using the `xargs` Linux utility:
```sh
$ docker ps --filter status=exited -q | xargs docker rm
```

### Volumes
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/volume/

Manage volumes. Usage: `docker volume COMMAND`

#### Create a volume
```sh
$ docker volume create
```

#### List volumes

```sh
$ docker volume ls
```

Show names and mount point destinations of volumes used by a container:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30133664/how-do-you-list-volumes-in-docker-containers

```sh
$ docker container inspect \
 -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ .Name }}:{{ .Destination }} {{ end }}' \
 <CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME>
```

#### Inspect volume

```sh
$ docker volume inspect
```

#### Remove volumes
Remove unused local volumes:
```sh
# With confirmation dialogue
$ docker volume prune

# Without confirmation
$ docker volume prune -f
```

Remove one or more volumes:
```sh
$ docker volume rm <volumes>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fix `permission denied` error
If you get the *permission denied* error while building the service scripts, make the script file executable:
```sh
$ chmod +x start
```

or:
```
$ chmod u+x clear
```

### Fix `failed to read dockerfile` error
If you get the *ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile* error while running the service, probably you have your *Dockerfile* or other crucial static files missing. Run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.
