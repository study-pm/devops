# Lab #8: Create an image with ARG instruction
https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/beginners/dockerfile/arg.html

The `ARG` directive in *Dockerfile* defines the parameter name and defines its default value. This default value can be overridden by the `--build-arg <parameter name>=<value>` in the build command docker build.

```docker
`ARG <parameter name>[=<default>]`
```

The build parameters have the same effect as `ENV`, which is to set the environment variables. The difference is that the environment variables of the build environment set by `ARG` will not exist in the future when the container is running. But donâ€™t use `ARG` to save passwords and the like, because `docker history` can still see all the values.

## Assignment
- Writing a Dockerfile with `ARG` instruction
- Building Docker Image with default argument
- Running container `argv:v1`
- Passing the argument during image build time
- Running container `argv:v2`

## Command Line Tools
There are two prime commands for managing (starting and stopping) the provided service.

### Start the service
The following command runs the full command sequence:
```sh
$ ./start
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh start
```

### Stop the service
The following command clears all of the output (removing all possible side-effects) generated by running the *start* command:
```sh
$ ./clear
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh clear
```

### Underlying commands
There are multiple underlying scripts used for building the service functions. The sections below describe the commands used for managing the provided service and building the necessary resources.

#### Pre-requisite
There should be the following files (committed) in your working directory:
- *build1.Dockerfile*
- *build2.Dockerfile*

In case any of them missing, run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.

#### Writing a Dockerfile with `ARG` instruction

*Dockerfile*
```docker
FROM alpine:3.9.3
LABEL maintainer="Collabnix"
RUN apk add --update
RUN apk add curl
RUN rm -rf /var/cache/apk/
```

Placed into *[create.sh](./create.sh)*.

#### Building Docker Image with default argument

```sh
docker image build -t arg:v1 .
```

Placed into *[build.sh](./build.sh)*.

#### Running container `argv:v1`

```sh
$ docker run arg:v1

Welcome Collabnix, to Docker World!
```

Placed into *[run.sh](./run.sh)*.

#### Passing the argument(`WELCOME_USER`) during image build time using `--build-arg` flag

```sh
$ docker image build -t arg:v2 --build-arg WELCOME_USER=Savio .
```

#### Running container `argv:v2`

```sh
$ docker run arg:v2

Welcome Savio, to Docker World!
```

Placed into *[run.sh](./run.sh)*.

> **NOTE**: `ARG` is the only one instruction which can come before `FROM` instruction, but then `arg` value can be used only by `FROM`.

## Utils / Trivia

### Images

#### Build image
```sh
$ docker image build -t <tag> .
$ docker build -t <tag> . -f <dockerfile-name>
```

#### Browse image history
```sh
$ docker image history <image>

#### List images
```sh
# Lists all images
$ docker images
$ docker image ls

# List a specific image
$ docker images <image>
$ docker image ls <image>
$ docker images | grep "keyword(s)"
```

#### Remove images
Below are the three command aliases:
```sh
$ docker image remove <image>
$ docker image rm <image>
$ docker rmi <image>
```

### Containers

#### Create (run) a container
```sh
$ docker container run <container>
$ docker run <container>
```

#### List containers
```sh
# List running containers
$ docker ps
# Lists all (running and stopped) containers
$ docker ps -a
```

#### Exit the container shell
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to exit the container shell. This stops the running container.

If you want to detach from a container without stopping it, type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>. It will help you to turn interactive mode to daemon mode.

#### Remove containers
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/rm/

#### Remove a container
This removes the container referenced under the link `/redis`.
```sh
$ docker rm /redis

/redis
```

#### Force-remove a running container (`--force`)
This command force-removes a running container.
```sh
$ docker rm --force redis

redis
```

The main process inside the container referenced under the link `redis` will receive `SIGKILL`, then the container will be removed.

#### Remove all stopped containers
Use the [`docker container prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/prune/) command to remove all stopped containers, or refer to the [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/prune/) command to remove unused containers in addition to other Docker resources, such as (unused) images and networks.

Alternatively, you can use the `docker ps` with the `-q` / `--quiet` option to generate a list of container IDs to remove, and use that list as argument for the `docker rm` command.

Combining commands can be more flexible, but is less portable as it depends on features provided by the shell, and the exact syntax may differ depending on what shell is used. To use this approach on Windows, consider using PowerShell or Bash.

The example below uses `docker ps -q` to print the IDs of all containers that have exited (`--filter status=exited`), and removes those containers with the `docker rm` command:
```sh
$ docker rm $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q)
```

Or, using the `xargs` Linux utility:
```sh
$ docker ps --filter status=exited -q | xargs docker rm
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fix `permission denied` error
If you get the *permission denied* error while building the service scripts, make the script file executable:
```sh
$ chmod +x start
```

or:
```
$ chmod u+x clear
```

### Fix `failed to read dockerfile` error
If you get the *ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile* error while running the service, probably you have your *Dockerfile* or other crucial static files missing. Run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.
