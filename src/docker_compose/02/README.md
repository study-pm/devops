## Overview
The `docker-compose help` list out all the subcommands that can be used with `docker-compose`.Even you can try **`--help`** or **`-h`**.

## Pre-requisite
- Install Docker Engine or Docker Desktop
- Install Docker Compose or Compose plugin for Docker

## Assignment
- Check docker compose help

## Command Line Tools
There are two prime commands for managing (starting and stopping) the provided service.

### Start the service
The following command runs the full command sequence:
```sh
$ ./start
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh start
```

### Stop the service
The following command clears all of the output (removing all possible side-effects) generated by running the *start* command:
```sh
$ ./clear
```

alternatively:
```sh
$ sh clear
```

### Underlying commands
There are multiple underlying scripts used for building the service functions. The sections below describe the commands used for managing the provided service and building the necessary resources.

#### Checking docker-compose help command
```sh
$ docker-compose help

Define and run multi-container applications with Docker.

Usage:
  docker-compose [-f <arg>...] [options] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]
  docker-compose -h|--help

Options:
  -f, --file FILE             Specify an alternate compose file
                              (default: docker-compose.yml)
  -p, --project-name NAME     Specify an alternate project name
                              (default: directory name)
  --verbose                   Show more output
  --log-level LEVEL           Set log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  --no-ansi                   Do not print ANSI control characters
  -v, --version               Print version and exit
  -H, --host HOST             Daemon socket to connect to

  --skip-hostname-check       Don't check the daemon's hostname against the
                              name specified in the client certificate
  --project-directory PATH    Specify an alternate working directory
                              (default: the path of the Compose file)
  --compatibility             If set, Compose will attempt to convert deploy
                              keys in v3 files to their non-Swarm equivalent

```

#### Trying help commands for subcommands
Even you can try help for docker subcommands also

```sh
$ docker-compose build --help
Build or rebuild services.

Services are built once and then tagged as `project_service`,
e.g. `composetest_db`. If you change a service's `Dockerfile` or the
contents of its build directory, you can run `docker-compose build` to rebuild it.

Usage: build [options] [--build-arg key=val...] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --compress              Compress the build context using gzip.
    --force-rm              Always remove intermediate containers.
    --no-cache              Do not use cache when building the image.
    --pull                  Always attempt to pull a newer version of the image.
    -m, --memory MEM        Sets memory limit for the build container.
    --build-arg key=val     Set build-time variables for services.
    --parallel              Build images in parallel.
```

## Utils / Trivia

### Images

#### Build image
```sh
$ docker image build -t <tag> .
$ docker build -t <tag> . -f <dockerfile-name>
```

#### Browse image history
```sh
$ docker image history <image>

#### List images
```sh
# Lists all images
$ docker images
$ docker image ls

# List a specific image
$ docker images <image>
$ docker image ls <image>
$ docker images | grep "keyword(s)"
```

#### Remove images
Below are the three command aliases:
```sh
$ docker image remove <image>
$ docker image rm <image>
$ docker rmi <image>
```

### Containers

#### Create (run) a container
```sh
$ docker container run <image>
$ docker run <image>
```

#### List containers
```sh
# List running containers
$ docker ps
$ docker container ls

# Lists all (running and stopped) containers
$ docker ps -a
```

#### Exit the container shell
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to exit the container shell. This stops the running container.

If you want to detach from a container without stopping it, type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>. It will help you to turn interactive mode to daemon mode.

#### Remove containers
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/rm/

#### Remove a container
This removes the container referenced under the link `/redis`.
```sh
$ docker rm /redis

/redis
```

#### Force-remove a running container (`--force`)
This command force-removes a running container.
```sh
$ docker rm --force redis

redis
```

The main process inside the container referenced under the link `redis` will receive `SIGKILL`, then the container will be removed.

#### Remove all stopped containers
Use the [`docker container prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/prune/) command to remove all stopped containers, or refer to the [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/prune/) command to remove unused containers in addition to other Docker resources, such as (unused) images and networks.

Alternatively, you can use the `docker ps` with the `-q` / `--quiet` option to generate a list of container IDs to remove, and use that list as argument for the `docker rm` command.

Combining commands can be more flexible, but is less portable as it depends on features provided by the shell, and the exact syntax may differ depending on what shell is used. To use this approach on Windows, consider using PowerShell or Bash.

The example below uses `docker ps -q` to print the IDs of all containers that have exited (`--filter status=exited`), and removes those containers with the `docker rm` command:
```sh
$ docker rm $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q)
```

Or, using the `xargs` Linux utility:
```sh
$ docker ps --filter status=exited -q | xargs docker rm
```

### Volumes
https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/volume/

Manage volumes. Usage: `docker volume COMMAND`

#### Create a volume
```sh
$ docker volume create
```

#### List volumes

```sh
$ docker volume ls
```

Show names and mount point destinations of volumes used by a container:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30133664/how-do-you-list-volumes-in-docker-containers

```sh
$ docker container inspect \
 -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ .Name }}:{{ .Destination }} {{ end }}' \
 <CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME>
```

#### Inspect volume

```sh
$ docker volume inspect
```

#### Remove volumes
Remove unused local volumes:
```sh
# With confirmation dialogue
$ docker volume prune

# Without confirmation
$ docker volume prune -f
```

Remove one or more volumes:
```sh
$ docker volume rm <volumes>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fix `permission denied` error
If you get the *permission denied* error while building the service scripts, make the script file executable:
```sh
$ chmod +x start
```

or:
```
$ chmod u+x clear
```

### Fix `failed to read dockerfile` error
If you get the *ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile* error while running the service, probably you have your *Dockerfile* or other crucial static files missing. Run the *[create.sh](./create.sh)* script before executing the *start* command.

### Fix `docker-compose` error
If you get the `Command 'docker-compose' not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install docker-compose`, try running the same command as `docker compose` (without hyphen in between the words). If you wish to use `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`, install a cli running a suggested command:
```sh
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

The `docker compose` (with a space) is a newer project to migrate compose to Go with the rest of the docker project. This is the v2 branch of the docker/compose repo. It's been first introduced to Docker Desktop users, so docker users on Linux didn't see the command. In addition to migrating to Go, it uses the compose-spec, and part of the rewrite may result in behavior differences.

The original python project, called `docker-compose`, aka v1 of docker/compose repo, has now been deprecated and development has moved over to v2. To install the v2 docker compose as a CLI plugin on Linux, supported distribution can now install the docker-compose-plugin package. E.g. on debian, I run `apt-get install docker-compose-plugin`.

Linux installs have been updated by Docker to include compose v2 and docker-compose v1 is unlikely to receive any more updates.
